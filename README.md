# ReportsPlugin
Plugin allows you to report problems to the administration using a book in Minecraft

# How works
The player must enter the "/zglos" command, where he/she is given a book. Then he writes his problems in the book. When the book is written, he enters the "/zglos" command again. The gui opens, where he has to place the book in the free space. Then he has to click the green block. 
Once clicked, the plugin retrieves the text from the book and saves it to the MYSQL database
